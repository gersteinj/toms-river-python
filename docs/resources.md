## Python Language and Libraries

### Python
For this course, we'll be using Python 3. Although there are still people using Python 2, the Python foundation recommends that new users start with Python 3 unless they have an urgent need for something that only exists in Python 2.

I recommend installing the most recent stable version, highlighted at the top of the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you want to have a lot of data science packages pre-installed, you might want to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) instead.

### Pygame
In week 2, we'll use [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to incorporate graphics and sounds in our code. The easiest way to install pygame is to use the ```pip``` tool, which will automatically download and install it from the command line.

```powershell
pip install pygame
```
