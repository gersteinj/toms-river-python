# Resources

## Beginner-Friendly Coding

* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and [Snap](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html) are really great ways of learning the logic of programming without needing to think about text at all. No login required.
* [Trinket](https://trinket.io) has a variety of ways of looking at code. It can be embedded in webpages. Content includes music and physics. Trinket has block-based turtle (the graphical programming we were doing) options that will let you shift between block-based and text-based code.
* [Makecode](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode?rtc=1) has several resources for working with resources from electronics to Minecraft.
* All of these have teacher resources available

## Resources for Chromebooks

* All of my beginner resources are Chromebook-friendly
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) is a web-based coding environment that works with a variety of languages and supports setting up classrooms to work more easily with students. [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) is similar, but Python-specific. It can do some things that Replit can't, but Replit is more beginner-friendly and more versatile.

## Python Language and Libraries

### Python
For this course, we'll be using Python 3. Although there are still people using Python 2, the Python foundation recommends that new users start with Python 3 unless they have an urgent need for something that only exists in Python 2.

I recommend installing the most recent stable version, highlighted at the top of the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you want to have a lot of data science packages pre-installed, you might want to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) instead.

### Pygame
In week 2, we'll use [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to incorporate graphics and sounds in our code. The easiest way to install pygame is to use the ```pip``` tool, which will automatically download and install it from the command line.

```powershell
pip install pygame
```

## Learning Resources

* [Al Sweigart](https://inventwithpython.com/) has several excellent books on Python
