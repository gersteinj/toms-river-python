### Day 7

Goals:

* Continue Pygame
* Refactor code

Skills:

* Modify existing code to include more advanced functionality
* Work with sprites
* Work with sound

Activities:

* Sprites and sounds
* Project 7: Update one of the previous games with sprites and sounds
* Introduce final challenge (students create game of their choice - default if they can't think of anything is Dodgeball)

### Day 8

Goals:

* Create a game of students' choice

Skills:

* Will vary for each student

Activities:

* Final challenge: Freely chosen game

### Notes
After the first day, I'll have a better feel for how quickly the students will be able to move. If possible, I'll include some algorithms and simple AI on Day 4
